# BGSwapper
An application to **automatically** crop background of an image using CoreML 3 [WIP] 

This application uses the DeepLabV3 model to detect the subject of the image. 
(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab)


Technologies used:
* Swift UI
* CoreML 3
* iOS 13
* Swift 5

------------
The idea is to push the app to the app store when it is ready and also **open source** the code.
